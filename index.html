                    I was in charge of monitoring a building that contained practice rooms and a computer lab for music
                    majors to
                    use. I made sure everyone complied with the building and computer lab rules.

                    </center>
                    Participated in a global online coding competition, consisting of three-hour rounds of a variety of
                    algorithmic
                    challenges designed by google engineers.This was my first hackathon that I attended. It was a fun
                    experience, I wasn't very successful
                    in the competition, but the important thing was that I had fun with the challenge and the
                    experience.

                    </center>
                    Worked on a project with a team which won 2nd place, where we created a solution to
                    support low income or displaced families on finding and securing housing or other vital resources.
                    Created an
                    app using flutter/dart and the google map api that gathers nearby resources based on
                    userâ€™s location and preference.
