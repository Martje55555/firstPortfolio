                    I was in charge of monitoring a building that contained practice rooms and a computer lab for music
                    majors to
                    use. I made sure everyone complied with the building and computer lab rules.

                        Participated in a global online coding competition, consisting of three-hour rounds of a variety
                        of
                        algorithmic
                        challenges designed by google engineers.This was my first hackathon that I attended. It was a
                        fun
                        experience, I wasn't very successful
                        in the competition, but the important thing was that I had fun with the challenge and learned
                        from the
                        experience.

                        Worked on a project with a team which won 2nd place, where we created a solution to
                        support low income or displaced families on finding and securing housing or other vital
                        resources.
                        Created an app using flutter/dart and the google map api that gathers nearby resources based on
                        userâ€™s location and preference.The hackathon was a lot of fun as I attended with two of my
                        friends that I work well with,
                        which made things easier and smoother. The hackathon ran for over 36 hours, and I did not sleep
                        during the whole duration.
                        The sleepless nights were worth it as we ended up taking 2nd place in the HackTx Wayfair: Hack
                        for Housing Inequality challenge!
