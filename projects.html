                    <p>HomeMe was created as a project for HackTX 2020 Hackathon (won 2nd place), for the
                        Wayfair: Hack for Housing Inequality challenge. My team consisted of
                        two of my friends (Carlos Zarate & Tyresse Lopez). Our goal was to
                        create a solution to support low income or displaced families on finding
                        and securing housing or other vital resources based on their given
                        location and the user's preference. We implemented this app using a varitey
                        of resources including Flutter/Dart and the google map api. The app still has
                        much to be added to until it is finished, but it is something that I would like
                        to get done and have it out for anyone who might find use for it.

                        Simple Hangman Web App deployed with
                        Heroku, and written using Ruby 
                        and Sinatra Framework. Start a new game by
                        clicking on the new game button, and start 
                        guessing! Lower or upper case letters are 
                        accepted, anything else is considered invalid.
                         If multiple letters are entered, it will only
                         accept the first letter. You have 7 wrong attempts
                         until you lose! Goodluck! :)
