    <p>HomeMe was created as a project for HackTX 2020 Hackathon (won 2nd place), for the
        Wayfair: Hack for Housing Inequality challenge. My team consisted of
        two of my friends (Carlos Zarate & Tyresse Lopez). Our goal was to 
        create a solution to support low income or displaced families on finding
        and securing housing or other vital resources based on their given 
        location and the user's preference. We implemented this app using a varitey
        of resources including Flutter/Dart and the google map api. The app still has
        much to be added to until it is finished, but it is something that I would like
        to get done and have it out for anyone who might find use for it.
