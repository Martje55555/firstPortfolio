<p>I come from a family of 6 in 
a small city in Texas called Alton. 
I attended Highschool at Mission Highschool and graduated in 2018.
I graduated as a Mission Merit, and in the top 10% of my
class. I am currently a junior attending the University of Texas
Rio Grande Valley, pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering.
When I am not studying I enjoy playing video games, watching sports
and training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Currently I am looking for a role
where I can help contribute and make an impact, while at the same time
grow my skills and learn from other experienced team members. The job searching
experience has been tough so far, but some of my greatest strengths include
patience, commitment, hard work and dedication, which will help greatly 
in my job searching.
